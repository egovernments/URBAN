# Cache Management Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve caching issues in the eGov application, particularly the `TypeError: Z.getCaheData(...) is not iterable` error.

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing caching issues where:
1. Users would get errors when logging in after a long time (1+ days)
2. The error `TypeError: Z.getCaheData(...) is not iterable` would appear in the console
3. Users had to hard refresh and clear cookies to resolve the issue
4. Cached localization data was becoming corrupted or stale

## Root Cause

The issue was in the localization service (`Localization/service.js`) where:
1. The `getCaheData` function was returning `null` or non-array values
2. The code was trying to spread (`...`) these values without proper validation
3. Cache expiration and corruption handling was insufficient
4. No fallback mechanisms were in place

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Localization Service (`Localization/service.js`)

**Key Changes:**
- Added proper null checks and array validation in `getCaheData`
- Implemented try-catch blocks around all cache operations
- Added automatic cache corruption detection and cleanup
- Enhanced error handling with fallback mechanisms
- Added cache clearing utilities

**New Methods:**
- `clearCorruptedCache(locale)` - Clears corrupted cache for specific locale
- `clearAllCache()` - Clears all localization cache

### 2. Improved Storage Utility (`Utils/Storage.js`)

**Key Changes:**
- Added JSON parsing error handling
- Implemented cache structure validation
- Added automatic cleanup of corrupted entries
- Enhanced error logging and recovery

### 3. Enhanced Store Service (`Store/service.js`)

**Key Changes:**
- Added cache validation before application initialization
- Implemented automatic cache cleanup on startup
- Added retry mechanisms for localization loading
- Enhanced error handling for cache-related failures

### 4. Cache Management Utility (`utils/cacheManager.js`)

**New Utility Functions:**
- `clearAllCache()` - Clear all Digit-related cache
- `clearLocalizationCache()` - Clear only localization cache
- `clearLocaleCache(locale)` - Clear cache for specific locale
- `validateAndCleanCache()` - Validate and remove corrupted entries
- `getCacheStats()` - Get cache statistics
- `forceRefresh()` - Clear cache and reload application
- `clearCacheAndRedirectToLogin()` - Clear cache and redirect to login

## Usage

### For Developers

```javascript
import CacheManager from '../utils/cacheManager';

// Clear all cache
CacheManager.clearAllCache();

// Clear only localization cache
CacheManager.clearLocalizationCache();

// Get cache statistics
const stats = CacheManager.getCacheStats();
console.log(stats);

// Force refresh application
CacheManager.forceRefresh();
```

### For Users (Browser Console)

```javascript
// Clear all cache and reload
window.DigitCacheManager.forceRefresh();

// Clear only localization cache
window.DigitCacheManager.clearLocalizationCache();

// Get cache statistics
window.DigitCacheManager.getCacheStats();
```

### For Debugging

The cache manager is available globally as `window.DigitCacheManager` for debugging purposes.

## Prevention Measures

1. **Automatic Cache Validation**: Cache is validated on application startup
2. **Corruption Detection**: Corrupted cache entries are automatically detected and removed
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: If cache loading fails, the system automatically clears cache and retries
4. **Error Logging**: All cache-related errors are logged for debugging

## Cache Expiration

- **Localization Cache**: 24 hours (86400 seconds)
- **MDMS Cache**: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- **FSM Module Cache**: 2 hours (7200 seconds)

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Simulate Cache Corruption**:
   ```javascript
   // Corrupt a cache entry
   localStorage.setItem('Digit.Locale.en_IN.List', 'invalid-json');
   ```

2. **Test Cache Clear**:
   ```javascript
   // Clear cache and verify recovery
   window.DigitCacheManager.clearAllCache();
   window.location.reload();
   ```

3. **Test Long-term Login**:
   - Log in to the application
   - Wait for cache to expire (or manually clear)
   - Try logging in again after a day
   - Verify no errors occur

## Monitoring

Monitor the browser console for:
- Cache validation messages
- Corrupted cache removal notifications
- Error recovery attempts
- Cache statistics

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Clear All Cache**: Use `CacheManager.clearAllCache()`
2. **Check Console**: Look for cache-related error messages
3. **Verify Network**: Ensure localization API is accessible
4. **Check Browser Storage**: Verify localStorage is available and not full

## Future Improvements

1. **Cache Versioning**: Implement cache versioning to handle schema changes
2. **Compression**: Add cache compression for large datasets
3. **Background Refresh**: Implement background cache refresh before expiration
4. **Metrics**: Add cache hit/miss metrics for performance monitoring
